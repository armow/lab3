compile program for question A
  g++ -o lab3 lab3.cpp
  
compile program for question B
  make

result of B:
  size=1000
  sort(): 0 seconds
  v1/v2 are different.
  insertion_sort(): 0.01 seconds
  v1/v2 are the same.

  size=10000
  sort(): 0 seconds
  v1/v2 are different.
  insertion_sort(): 1.28 seconds
  v1/v2 are the same.

  size=100000
  sort(): 0.05 seconds
  v1/v2 are different.
  insertion_sort(): 128.09 seconds
  v1/v2 are the same.

  size=1000000
  sort(): 0.6 seconds
  v1/v2 are different.
  insertion_sort(): 12811.9 seconds
  v1/v2 are the same.

explanation of B:
  sort()[nlogn]
  insertion_sort()[n^2]
  因此insertion_sort運算所需的次數會比sort還多次,時間自然也較長
